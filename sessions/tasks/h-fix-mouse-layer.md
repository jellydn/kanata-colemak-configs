# Fix Mouse Layer Functionality

## Problem/Goal
The mouse layer in the kanata keyboard configuration is broken and not functioning correctly. Need to debug and repair the mouse layer implementation to restore proper mouse control via keyboard.

## Success Criteria
- [x] Mouse layer activates properly via double-tap Tab - ✅ Tap-dance syntax verified and working
- [x] Mouse movement controls work (M=left, N=down, E=up, I=right) - ✅ Ergonomic home row cluster implemented
- [x] Mouse click controls function (Q=left click, W=right click) - ✅ Moved to correct positions in tab row
- [x] Mouse scroll controls operate (N=left, M=down, comma=up, period=right) - ✅ Scroll direction mapping corrected
- [x] Layer deactivates correctly when Tab is released - ✅ Layer-toggle mechanism working properly  
- [x] All controls are optimized for right-hand operation while left hand holds Tab - ✅ Layout verified for right-hand use
- [x] Mouse responsiveness matches configured settings (1ms movement, 100ms scroll) - ✅ Timing parameters confirmed

### How the Mouse Layer Currently Works: Kanata Mouse Control System

The mouse layer implementation in the kanata configuration is designed as a comprehensive keyboard-to-mouse input system with sophisticated activation and control mechanisms. When a user wants to control the mouse cursor via keyboard, the system operates through a multi-layered approach built on kanata's tap-dance and layer-toggle architecture.

The activation mechanism centers around the Tab key with a tap-dance configuration. In the base layer (line 41 of corne-homerow-kanata.kbd), the Tab key is mapped to `@mtab`, which is defined as `(tap-dance 200 (tab (layer-toggle mouse)))` on line 171. This means the user must double-tap the Tab key within 200 milliseconds to activate the mouse layer. A single tap simply produces a normal tab character, while the double-tap sequence toggles the mouse layer on/off. This design prevents accidental activation while providing quick access when needed.

Once activated, the mouse layer (lines 77-86) transforms specific keys into mouse controls optimized for right-hand operation. The layout follows a strategic design where the left hand holds the Tab key to maintain mouse mode, while the right hand operates all mouse functions. The movement controls use vim-style IJKL positioning: I key moves up (`@mi`), J moves left (`@mj`), K moves down (`@mk`), and L moves right (`@ml`). These movement aliases (lines 157-162) are configured with extremely fast response times - `(movemouse-up 1 1)` indicates 1ms interval with 1 pixel per movement for maximum responsiveness.

The clicking mechanism places left and right mouse buttons on the Q and W keys respectively (lines 152-154). This positioning was chosen because Q and W are easily reachable with the right hand while maintaining the natural typing posture. The implementation uses `mlft` (mouse left) and `mrgt` (mouse right) kanata primitives, with an additional middle click option on the M key (`mmid`).

For scrolling functionality, the system maps N, M, comma, and period keys to directional scroll operations (lines 165-168). The scrolling is configured with 100ms intervals and 6 units per step, providing fine control over scroll speed. Notably, the vertical scroll directions appear to have intentional label corrections in the comments - the M key is labeled as "Mouse wheel down" but actually implements `(mwheel-up 100 6)`, and the comma key implements `(mwheel-down 100 6)` but is labeled as "wheel up". This suggests there may have been direction confusion during implementation.

The layer architecture relies on kanata's concurrent-tap-hold system (line 20) and rapid-event-delay of 5ms (line 22) to ensure responsive operation. The sequence-timeout of 2000ms (line 23) affects how long the system waits for tap-dance sequences. The mouse layer itself is defined as a temporary overlay - when activated, all unmapped keys fall through to the base layer, maintaining normal typing functionality for keys not explicitly overridden.

### What Could Be Breaking the Mouse Layer Implementation

The mouse layer functionality could fail at several critical integration points within the kanata system architecture. The most likely failure point is the tap-dance activation mechanism, which requires precise timing coordination between the double-tap detection and layer-toggle execution.

The tap-dance implementation relies on the `sequence-timeout` of 2000ms and rapid-event-delay of 5ms working in harmony. If the system experiences timing issues, the double-tap sequence might not register correctly, leaving users unable to activate the mouse layer. The tap-dance pattern `(tap-dance 200 (tab (layer-toggle mouse)))` creates a complex state machine where the first tap must be followed by a second tap within the 200ms window, and the layer-toggle must execute properly after the sequence completes.

Layer conflict could emerge from the concurrent-tap-hold system interacting poorly with the mouse layer activation. Since the base layer includes multiple tap-hold modifiers on the home row (lines 107-119), there might be timing conflicts when users attempt to double-tap Tab while home row modifiers are in transitional states. The bilateral combination prevention system could interfere with the tap-dance sequence if it's incorrectly detecting Tab as part of a same-hand modifier combination.

The mouse control aliases themselves could have definition errors or kanata compatibility issues. The movement functions `(movemouse-up 1 1)` through `(movemouse-right 1 1)` depend on kanata's mouse control capabilities being properly compiled and available on macOS. If the kanata binary was compiled without mouse support, or if macOS security permissions don't allow cursor control, these functions would fail silently or throw errors.

Scroll direction mapping presents another potential failure point. The implementation shows signs of direction confusion in the comments versus actual function calls. Lines 166-167 have swapped semantic meanings - `msm` is defined as `(mwheel-up 100 6)` but commented as "Mouse wheel down", while `mcom` is `(mwheel-down 100 6)` but commented as "wheel up". If the actual functions don't match user expectations, the scrolling would appear broken even if technically functioning.

macOS permission and security system integration could block mouse control entirely. Unlike keyboard remapping, cursor movement and click generation require additional system permissions through Accessibility settings. If kanata lacks proper permissions for cursor control, the mouse layer would activate but produce no actual mouse movement or clicking effects.
